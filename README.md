# NEW SharpEngine CORE #

Simple **OpenGL-based** engine written completely in .NET Core.

*Faster, lighter and more compatabile successor of SharpEngine...*
https://github.com/majda107/SharpEngine

## Already working ##

* Keyboard processor (for processing key-presses)
* Mouse processor
* Camera, including mouse movement
* Inheritance-based object model 
* Interface-based object model - You can create your own objects that will modify with SharpEngine if you are brave enough!
* Configurable lightning 
* Transparency
* Basic hitbox rendering
* .obj loader
* Implement .mtl loader to .obj loader for textures and materials
* Working hitbox collisions (functions, events...) 
* Physics elements (Rigidbody with custom forces)

*You can see example of working hitbox collisions and custom forces in Game.cs class*

## Planned implementations ##

* Separated cameras (both first and third person)
* On-screen display (crosshair, stats...)
* Font to texture loader
* Fix hitbox rendering related to solid rotation
* Pivot and solid rotation
* Sectorized world (will improve performance by a LOT!)
* Ray intersection
* CFrame / LookVector?
* Better collision event system (should come soon!)
